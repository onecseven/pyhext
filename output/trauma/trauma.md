\lmost inevitably, the survivor has great difficulty protecting herself in the context of ntimate relationships, Her desperate longing for nurturance and care makes it 
difficult to establish safe and appropriate boundaries with others. Her tendency to 
denigrate herself and to idealize those to whom she becomes attached further — 
clouds her judgment. Her empathic attunement to the wishes of others and her 
automatic, often unconscious habits of obedience also make her vulnerable to 
anyone in a position of power or authority. Her dissociative defensive style makes it" 
difficult for her to form conscious and accurate assessments of danger. And her wish — 
to relive the dangerous situation and make it come out right may lead her into 
reenactments of the abuse.
