from one particular part of it (ef. David's dread of female impersonation) The individual in this position is invariably terrifyingly ‘self-conscious’ (see Chapter 7) in the sense in which this ‘word is used to mean the exact opposite, namely, the feeling ‘of being under observation by the other. These changes in the relationship between the different aspects of the person's relation to himself are constantly associated Wwithy/his|interperSonal relationships. ‘These are ‘complex and never quite the same from person to person. The individual's selfxelationship becomes a pseudo- interpersonal one, and the self treats the false selves as though they were other people whom it depersonalizes. David, for instance, referring to a part he played which he found was disliked, said: Tt had a nasty tongue.’ From within, the self now looks out at the false things being said and done and detests the speaker and doer as though he were someone else. In all this there is an attempt to create relationships to persons and things within the individual without recourse to the Outer WORKA/OF persons/and things at all.

You are worthless.’ However, if he persisted and refused to endorse this false counsel of conscience, he did not feel so futile, unreal, or dead, and he did not smell so badly.

This deadness permeated his experience of his ‘uncoupled self, his experience of his body, and his perception of the ‘disconnected’ world. Everything began to come to a stop. ‘The world came to lose what reality it had for him and he
