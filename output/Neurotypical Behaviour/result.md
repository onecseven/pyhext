        Some symbols have no clear signified; they are semantically starved, which is_ 
        to say they don’t mean much in any literal sense, but they are still symbols in 
        the symbolic web, These are referred to later in the book as free-floating 
        cultural symbols , such as “Victorian ” and “gourmet, ” Their main purpose 
        is to be associated with other symbols, rather than to refer to any real thing in 
        the world.

        “beaver.” A myriad of rays of light from the beaver hits the stencil, but only 
        the word “beaver” comes out the other side. This is just an analogy to help 
        show how language works, It’s a massive reduction and simplification of the

Other  parts of the environment that don’t fit the symbolic web are not admitted.

        ‘The social reality pattern is the extension of this theory of social  construction into the realm of truch and reality. In is strongest form, the  person cannot differentiate between consensus opinion and reality, and he  apparently has few independent thoughts derived from his own experience,  and instead assumes that the only ching thats true is what is communicated. 
        Pluto was recently re- 
        categorized from a planet to a different type of orbiting body, and of course 
        there were no changes on Pluto itself on account of the change of name. 
        Some NTs apparently felt they were losing a planet that was dear to their 
        hearts. For those people, the socially constructed name and categorization of 
        the rock is more “reality” than the rock itself, or they cannot differentiate 
        between the name (which exists in their belief web in their minds) and the 
        actual rock (which exists very far away). 
####page-45.png:
        So, why is there a word if it doesn’t mean anything? It does mean something, 
        associatively. That means it has connections to other symbols, but it is not a 
        sign that stands for a particular signified.

        _ Words with their collections of loaded meanings become one inseparable ball  of wax, with a single name, For example, at a public meeting on road  construction, I heard someone say they wanted to remove the orange barrels  frst chought that cher proposal was to do the construction project without  the use of the protective orange barrels, which I thought would be foolish. As  I learned later, the person was referring to the entite construction site 38  Forange barrels,” and by asking to remove the barrels, was indirectly asking to  cancel the whole construction job. 
        The NT 
        mind is often not good at distinguishing appearances from the facts that 
        underlie those appearances. To appear to do good is doing good. To claim 
        that one is supportive is the same as being supportive.

        a door handle to placing a jacket over a chair is done with the thought of how — 
        the action will appear to others. And they assume that every tiny action done 
        by others is done for the same reason.

        Confidence indicates the level of force with which cultural propositions are_ 
        sent out by one person and received by another. It is important to understand — 
        that in social interaction, confidence is not necessarily related to its scientific 
        meaning of the probability of accuracy, A person can be extremely confident — 
        about something that is not true at all in any literal sense. 
        Confidence is to communication as certainty is to knowledge, The pattern 
        of certainty has to do with how strongly a belief is held in the mind; the 
        pattern of confidence has to do with how effectively a belief is sent out to 
        People attain power over others through their mastery of confidence. The 
        more confidently something is said, the more it is believed, and the more the 
        person becomes an authority. It is only possible to rise to power politically if _ 
        one has a high confidence level in everything he or she does, and expresses that _ 
        powerfully so that others are practically forced to believe. 
####page-115.png:
        When exhibiting “common sense,” NTs are preoccupied with what is, 
        appropriate (conforming to culture), instead of what is true or beneficial. | 
        (Common = shared; Common sense = shared web 
        of beliefs.) When “common sense” is used as a justification for an action, this 
        is a bit like saying “because everyone else does it.” \ 
        Consider the example of the choice to use gasoline or lighter fluid to start « 
        wood fire. Without any prior knowledge of the subject, a person might not 
        know that gasoline is more more flammable than lighter fluid, and might not 
        have enough experience to know what the dangers are, or what other 
        questions to ask. Using common sense in this situation would mean ot 
        thinking about it, but instead just doing what other people do in the situation 
        (“Lighter fluid is appropriate, so I'll use lighter fluid.”) 
        The alternative | 
        approach would be to experiment, ask questions, and understand, then apply _ 
        knowledge of the subject to get the best results. In this example, common 
        sense is probably safer than experimentation, since experimenting with 
        gasoline can be dangerous. 
####page-116.png:
        Common sense is a pattern that inhibits change, and protects people from 
        mistakes. But when common sense is the only pattern affecting decisions, 
        then large, complicated problems cannot be solved. 
        They might say “It’s just obvious!” This is 
        because the shared belief web is so inherent to the way they think and_ 
        perceive, that they,can’t easily separate it out. | 
####page-117.png:
        Groupfeel is the phenomenon of a group making the assumption that they 
        have the same views and feelings. For example, when a person feels sad_ 
        watching a movie, she might say “You felt so sad ar the end.” Using the 
        pronoun “you” (unstressed) indicates the assumption thar the other person, 
        or all people, feel the same thing as she did. | 
        So the phenomenon 
        of groupfeel is mainly about the asstempeion of similarity. 
        Groupfeel is similar to the concept of “theory of mind,” which is the ability — 
        to project ones mental state onto others and guess their actions and motives. 
        Theory of mind is a concept in autism research, used to show that autistics are 
        less capable or willing to assume that other's views and feclings are the same as_ 
        ones own, or that they would act the same given the same information, 
        Itis impossible for her to know that for sure, 
        but if the assumption is unchallenged, then it stands as social reality. 
####page-118.png:
        All the defense mechanisms exist to keep ourselves unaware of ourselves, 
        specifically to maintain ones constructed identity and the truth value of the 
        belief web, and defend those beliefs against the intrusion of reality as revealed 
        by the senses. 
####page-119.png:
        In childhood, repression starts with a painful memory or guilt; that item is_ 
        taken away from the consciousness to protect the conscious identity, and that 
        original symbol pulls down other symbols that are associated with it. Think — 
        of the associations as chains that pull down symbols into the unconscious — 
        level. The unconscious mind is gradually filled in that manner. 
        Freudian therapy using word associations causes patients to cross the line 
        into the unconscious by finding conscious symbols that have an association 
        with unconscious symbols. By pulling chains of symbols back up into the 
        conscious mind, it is possible to reverse repression and, sometimes, to access 
        the original event. Some people who have experienced violent crimes say they _ 
        have “forgotten,” but really they remember it very well, in a place that is sealed 
        off from consciousness. 
####page-120.png:
        My field observations have led me to the informal conclusion that a vast 
        majority of what NTs say about others is projection, | 
        example, when someone often accuses people of stealing, he is probably — 
        someone who steals himself. * 
        In the play, there are many examples of projection: Angel accuses other 
        people of being “dramatic” when it is clear to the outside observer that she is 
        the one being dramatic. ‘Tony accuses Ivan of being financially irresponsible, 
        which Tony cannot accept is his own flaw. 
        Paul could have said Carmen was 
        exciting or loving or loyal, or any number of other things, but he said she was 
        “interesting.” That reveals that Paul is concerned about where he himself ison 
        the scale of boring to interesting. He would be less likely to comment on 
        things about people having to do with factors that he has no self-concern 
        NTs can confuse empathy with projection. | 
####page-121.png:
        value judgments, where this example was given: “Hummers are awesome.” 
        This is semantically not far from saying “I am awesome; I like Hummers.” It 
        sets the speaker close to the thing being judged; it is projecting and 
        associating. 
        If you are living among the NTs, I would advise you to treat any adjective as_ 
        suspicious. It may have a lot more to do with the speaker's identity than 
        anything else. 
####page-122.png:
        Denial is the defense mechanism of stating the opposite of what you 
        (perhaps only unconsciously) know is true, to avoid facing it. 
        An autistic observer who hasn’t internalized the same sense of what is_ 
        appropriate and inappropriate will more likely be able to see the confusion 
        and anger under the displayed emotion, when NTs cover their “bad” 
        emotions. Has this happened to you? 
####page-124.png:
        The natural independence of autistic people is different from NT rebellion, 
        because autistics are less likely trying to prove to anyone that they aren't 
        following the herd. They are failing to follow the herd because they can’t 
        follow herds, not because they are seeking attention for being “different.”

        Relational emotions" 
        Rage is anger, combined with denial about an unwanted possibility, 
        Shame is sadness, plus the belief in having less value than others, or having 
        desert of punishment. To shame another person is to cause their feeling of 
        shame. 
        Guilt is both a relational emotion and a quality applied to others. As an_ 
        emotion, it is sadness, combined with the belief that one is a bad person. It 
        can be a generalization of a single mistake to a judgment of ourselves as a 
        bad person overall. As a 
        Envy is possibly fear, combined with the belief of having less value than 
        others (or less power). 
        Offense is disgust, plus having ones identity threatened. | 
####page-127.png:
        A nonverbal gesture that 
        destroys the flag is a semantic attack against the network of chained 
        symbols, and it perceived as an attack against a person’s very identity. 
        Trampling the American flag would be done precisely because itis such an_ 
        effective way to cause pain, | 
        Schadenfreude is happiness about the suffering of others. 
        Respect is fear and the belief that the other has high rank. 
        Dignity is contentment with autonomy, or being deserving of respect. 
        (Undignitied behavior causes a loss of respect from others.) 
        Anxiety is fear of not being able to control the future, mixed with the 
        belief that we can control it, (Anxiety is not always relational.) 
        Resentment is giving a “gift” wich an expectation (or having something  taken), and being sad about not getting anything in return. 
####page-132.png:
        Children use the word “friends” for people they play with, people who make 
        them laugh, and people they want to give to out of love, without an 
        expectation of reward. I maintained this childhood definition well into my 
        30s, thinking that everyone who referred to anyone as a “friend” was using — 
        that word to indicate warmth and affection. For NT adults, however, the 
        word often becomes more restricted and is also used to indicate people who 
        are in the same identity group, those you have a strategic alliance with, will _ 
        stand up for you, or who are on your side in a conflict, Friends can be defined — 
        as the opposite of enemies, and friendship does not necessarily imply any 
        warmth, 
        If you spend time among NTs and have been confused by their use of the 
        word “friend,” try substituting in your mind the term “strategic ally.” 
        NTs can switch from friend to enemy status quickly depending on what 
        group membership is most beneficial. Switching from friend to enemy is 
        called backstabbing. — 
        If you do not pass the test to be someone's friend, then he might consider _ 
        you to be his enemy. An autistic person who does not participate in strategic 
        alliances will fail these tests, and might therefore be classified as the enemy, for 
        NTs who strongly exhibit the pattern of friends and enemies. For them, there 
        is no middle ground, 
        ‘The friends/enemies pattern is the foundation of politics.

        You have to agree beforehand 
        to play one game or the other, and not shift into an ambiguous collage of two 
        games. So it is with categorized relationships: you must either be one thing or _ 
        the other, but the rule is you can’t invent your own relationship type. Some 
        common scripts are dominant/submissive, vying for power, and standing up 
        for each other. NTs don’t necessarily pick a script and play it out forever, but 
        at any one time it forms the frame of understanding of the relationship. 
        NTs communicate which game is being played while simultaneously  comanuniaing the content. or moves of the game, They use muller  communication ro send and receive both levels atthe same time, The game of 
        a relationship is more primal or fundamental than the content, so the game is 
        more likely to be communicated using facial expressions and gestures, while 
        the content may be communicated with words. NTs adjust their

        For example, you might say something intimate, and the _ 
        NT will understand that you are playing the game where the male chats up  the female for eventual sex; therefore what you said was classified as a move in  that game. The NT response is a counter-move- possibly ayes or no expressed  inditecly. Or, you mighe say how you feel abour the new state governor, and  it could be taken a5 a cue that you are playing conflict game, if the NT was  in a different political identity group. In that case anything else you say would 
        be heard as a further move in that game. | 
        Once the 
        conflict game is established, most statements can be twisted into moves 
        justifying the game.

####page-139.png:
        Lying is considered a normal and acceptable thing to do among NTs, despite 
        what they may say about it. Since a main purpose of their communication is 
        manipulation, communicating lies is just one of the ways of achieving that 
        When words - 
        are used that are not true, but they are used for a positive effect, it is not 
        considered lying because lying is negative, and something that is positive can’t 
        be negative. 
        Being offensive (sce the pattern on relational emotions on page 120) 
        is considered worse than lying, so NTs will usually avoid being offensive, and 
        lic if necessary to achieve that. 
####page-140.png:
        (Lying differs from denial in the sense that denial protects _ 
        the mind from its own unconscious and is hard co control, while lying is done 
        intentionally to deceive others.) 
####page-142.png:
        Sriginal source of the conflict has faded, 
        Recall that the form of the script is more primal than the content. The - 
        content is whax they disagree about; the for is the structure or script of the 
        relationship, which in this case is the fact that they disagree. So in a conflict, if | 
        it is discovered that both parties actually desire the same course of action, the 
        conflict will not necessarily be ended at that point. If the two sides have 
        decided that they are in conflict, that becomes the structure of their story. 
        Again, the form is more primal than the content. One party might change 
        their position or intentionally misunderstand the other party’s position in 
        order to remain in conflict, 
        The pattern of being neutral, hearing evidence 
        dispassionately, and making up ones mind in the manner of a judge is rare 
        among NTs. 
####page-143.png:
        Many times, I've fallen into the conflict pattern inadvertently. I don’t show 
        that I am a “friend” of someone; that is, I don’t make a strategic alliance with 
        them. Then, they interpret my non-alliance to be the enemy relationship 
        category. They then interpret what relationship game I’m playing by 
        deduction from my gestures or other nonverbal means. Since I'm not 
        intentionally giving out any game signals, I might accidentally give out signals _ 
        that tell them I'm playing the dominance game - vying for power. 
        Consequently my opinion must be the opposite of theirs (according to NT 
        social logic). If they have stated their opinion and I have not, my opinion can 
        be inferred, and there is not need for them to ask. If I then state an opinion 
        that they didn’t expect, I must be lying, playing “mind games,” confusing — 
        them, waiting in ambush, shielding the enemy, or doing some other aggressive

        The important thing is that conflicts among NTs are played out on the level _ 
        of symbols, and might have no basis in natural-world conflicts. In other _ 
        words, they might not be natural conflicts in the sense that one course of © 
        action is prevented by another course of action.

        been carried out, but which serve to maintain control that the two people 
        have over each other, 
        Political power appears to be based on a complex network of power in  individual relationships. Its not given to those with the best ideas.

        take any content (such as: whether there are any cookies left) and place it in a 
        win/lose form, approaching the content with concerns like: who got the most _ 
        cookies (that is, who won)? and if I didn’t win, then can I change the game to

        construction composed of two basic beliefs: (1) Life is essentially about 
        achievement or success, and we are in an eternal competition to achieve the 
        most; and (2) achievement can be measured by other people. Different people 
        strive for different things: more possessions, more education, more generosity,

        So they strive ta be only

        For example, a professor may write books that may contain a handful of new 
        thoughts, but mainly reiterate beliefs already known to the profession, and 
        give lots of acknowledgment to her colleagues; in turn, the colleagues repay — 
        her by giving her higher rank, In this way she rises to the top of her field. Ifshe_

        of her field, she would be cast out and would not have achieved anything. 
        To achieve high rank, the NT must either (1) change himself so that he is_ 
        better than others at something, or (2) change the game, so that whatever he 
        happens to be good at becomes valued in his identity group. Or a

        For example, 
        new sports are pushed by the people who play them so that they achieve a 
        status of legitimacy in athletics, no matter how ridiculous they might seem to 
        the prior generation. The pushers do that in order to spin the culture in their

        Reward and punishment are doled out intentionally and serve to keep the - 
        ultimate pattern going, particularly in schools. Recall from the desert pattern 
        (page 119 ) that people can be symbolically deserving of a reward. The desert _ 
        is seen as coming from the achievement. The actual reward could be nothing — 
        more than a symbol of reward with no intrinsic value. A sheet of gold star 
        stickers may cost only 10 cents, but there is symbolic value in having a high 
        ranking person (such as a teacher) affix one of the stars on a homework paper. 
        That symbol bestows higher rank on the achiever. The social logic is: 
        achievement —* desert —* reward —* rank. In schools, examples of 
        punishment are detention or ex  ctra busy-work, 
        If you have lived among the N'Is for a long while, you may have taken in the 
        ultimate pattern quite deeply, as I have. Autistic readers have likely had the | 
        experience of being told they have failed, or they are a failure . or they will 
        never achieve something (or anything). Have you heard this? Have you also 
        been told false-sounding encouragement that you will succeed? If you are

        When going for a job interview, it is best for the NT to be 
        confident of her job skills on account of actually having the skills, But if she 
        doesn’t have the skills, she is expected to feign confidence anyway. The word — 
        “confidence” has to do with the presentation of being sure of yourself, 
        regardless of how grounded that is in reality. 
        NT life is a lot like poker in this respect, and perhaps that is how poker 
        became popular. In poker, each player attempts to display confidence that 
        their cards are the best hand, regardless of their actual cards. A good player  can detect the difference between feigned and reasoned confidence in the  other players. Aa certain point in the game, you often have to ether get out  (cut the losses) or make a challenge. The challenge involves raising the bet to  the level that shatters the others confidence, so that they get ous, leaving you  the winnings. 
        Autistic can be misinterpreted as battling confidence, in cases when they are  actually just insisting on their own independent point of view. 
####page-154.png:
        Much of the apparatus of non-profits, religions, and 
        other instruments of “good” is driven by NTs who are in fierce competition 
        for rank, achievement, sex, reputation, etc, Even when and if they are “nice,” 
        helpful, generous, and pious, that does not mean they have given up on all the _ 
        NT patterns, 
        Some NTs can fight for an endangered species or the rights of the poor, and 
        they can do it with passion, and it is done in the context of their constructed — 
        identity and against an opposing group. — 
        Please don’t make the mistake of thinking that all people who appear “good” - 
        have somehow advanced beyond the patterns in this book. They may appear 
        “good” becawse they are good at the patterns. 
####page-176.png:
        Socializing is the synchronization of the belief webs of different people. NTs_ 
        share their beliefs repeatedly, and adapt to each other, changing their beliefs to _ 
        conform to each other, The result is that people in the same group have the 
        same knowledge and beliefs, use the same language, and also share the same 
        free-floating symbols. That is, they share the same culture. 
        Frequently, social situations are fundamentally competitive. NTs compete 
        for power, sex, and recognition. They love competing and conforming - and 
        excel at it. | 
####page-177.png:
        At the beginning of the book, I said _ 
        that NTs sometimes appear to autistics as a herd of clones that waste their 
        time talking about nothing. | hope the book convinced you otherwise: that 
        the time spent “talking about nothing” is not wasted, but is needed for them 
        to be able to use all the other patterns and be effective in their society.

        The word — 
        “Hispanic” denotes ethnicity (not language). The word “White” also denote _ 
        ethnicity (not color). All of those labels denote ethnicity - a myriad of — 
        associations including accent, hair styles, and music. A “Black” person could — 
        be lighter colored than a “White” person because the labels don’t really refer 
        to color; they refer to ethnicity. The symbols are free-floating in the sense that 
        they cannot be precisely defined.

        Someone in a social group 
        might say “let’s go sce a movie” and that becomes “the plan” depending on   their rank and confidence. If someone of higher rank says “I wanted to go out   to eat” then that becomes another plan in the shared belief web - perhaps   having higher truth vale, and pulling away the truth ofthe frst plan, There   may be other opinions stated, but the game being played is na one in which  I opinions are equally valued, and there is usually not a vote. 
        “I'm going to get tacos, Who else wants some?” - This would be the

        wording of someone who is denying the system of rank (perhaps an 
        autistic), or is in a situation where practical needs override social relations.

        and tired, they may omit the usual social considerations.

        Gender is possibly the strongest single component of identity among NTs. 
        When a baby is born, the first question asked is often “what is it?” The 
        juestion is about the identity of the baby, which is assumed based on its sex. — 
        The phrase “Be a man!” does not mean to please have male sex organs; it 
        means to conform to all the masculine things associated with manhood in the 
    
        and girls’ toys, even for very young children. A great many details of NT 
        behavior are determined by gender - for example, where money is kept (what  kind of wallet or purse), how they protect cheir eyes From the sun, and the  kind of soap chey use. 
        “mixed company” (a term that refers specifically to mixed 
        gender, not any other kind of identity mixing). All-male or all-female groups 
        might signal each other to change the style and topics when a person of the 
        other gender comes in the room.

        In the example of children seeing each other's bodies, the offended — 
        teacher probably believes that the children are actually hurting each other. By 
        crossing the line dividing the identity groups, they are being inappropriate 
        (refer to the common sense pattern on page 110 ), and therefore losing their 
        identity. Referring back to the sexual tease pattern, it is essential to keep 
        certain body parts covered in order to create competition, more potential 
        mates, and ultimately, higher rank. If the females of the herd don’t learn this 
        pattern carly, their rank will suffer in the long term. 1

        Recall from the _

        “be something,” which is to say it has to be a member of category denoted by _ 
        a cultural symbol, One of the car symbols is the sedan, NTs often can’t tell 
        you what a sedan is, even if they claim to know what it is.

        N'Ts socialize a lot in order to learn and perpetuate the culture, and this is 
        done nearly everywhere, Certain venues exist mainly for that purpose, and 
        other things (often food) are a secondary reason, Examples are restaurants, 
        clubs, dances, parties, parades, and ritualized observances (weddings, funerals, 
        ag raisings). Since there is no competing need for something to get done and — 
        almost no new perceptual information to process, NTs focus all their energy — 
        at these times into symbolic processing. That is, they aren’t seeing or feeling — 
        the world around them with attention to detail, but are instead putting all _ 
        their mental power into synchronizing their cultural symbols. They are using — 
        the social communication patterns (such as small talk, intense 
        All of this can even be done while there is constant high sensory input such 
        as loud music, flashing lights, and smoke. Thanks to desensitization, many 
        NTs actually find several hours of symbolic manipulation under these 
        conditions to be quite refreshing.

        NT children want to please their parents, (I resisted believing this about NTs 
        for a very long time.) Children use the make-feel pattern to make their parents 
        feel proud by achieving external rewards. 
        I can generalize that boys are most often normalized to the male _ 
        identity group between ages 2 and 4. In that time, any behavior or dress that _ 
        associates too much with girls may be strongly shamed, and parents may try 
        to masculinize the boy by preventing playing with girlish toys and providing — 
        boy toys like guns and trucks. Girls are freer during the latent stage (which is 
        roughly elementary school years) and are normalized later, between ages 10 
        and 12, when their boyish behaviors are shamed and exterminated. — 
        Education of children in America is based primarily on the deficit model, 
        which focuses on what children don’t know yet. Success in educational policy 
        appears to be defined as 100% of students knowing the exact same 
        curriculum, and learning it at the exact same rate in the exact same sequence. 
        Any differences in a student's ability to learn or in their interests is considered — 
        a problem for a system that is built for conformity.

        There is also a sex-related dynamic. Males who become emotionally unstable 
        are more likely to end up in prison and be viewed in the conformity model _ 
        verhaps because they are more likely to hurt other people), while females 
        who become emotionally unstable are more likely to end up in mental 
        institutions and be viewed in the medical model (perhaps because they are 
        more likely to hurt themselves).

        And the diagnosis depends on — 
        the judgment of the doctor using socially constructed measures (like being — 
        “odd”) rather than unambiguous scientific measures. 
        A quick list is: autistics have (on average) larger brains, more and smaller 
        minicolumns (certain brain structures), lower functional connectivity among — 
        cortical regions, less firing of mirror neurons, less small motor control, less 
        development of the frontal lobe in the second decade, more use of the mental _ 
        imagery part of the brain to comprehend low-imagery information, — 
        preference for low level processing, more spread of excitation, and various 
        performance excellence in detailed tasks. 
        The root difference is that the autistic person develops a type of brain that  admits natural wnfiltered stimuli and does not filer i (as much) using  SGIEGHSI eal! The person does not become desensitized, and continues

        is more accurate to say that autistics have low acculturation (we assimilate and 
        conform less). While we don’t engage in the socializing pattern (as defined in 
        this book) as much as NTs, we might have as much of a need for connection — 
        to others as anyone else does. 
        “I believe that almost all of the things that are ‘wrong’ with AS people 
        are just a result of a poor culture-to-person fit, and of the snowballing — 
        fall-out from cognitive dissonance generated by the huge gulf between 
        the fairy-tales NTs believe are The Truth and the actual observable data.” 
        What she calls fairy-tales is what I’m calling socially constructed reality. Her 
        main point is that there is nothing “wrong” with us, but the differences can 
        cause major secondary effects, which may be commonly seen as “the 
        problem,” 
####page-209.png:
        “The ‘emotional difficulties’ of AS people seem to boil down to 4 things, 
        and none of them are about us being inherently detective. (1) we feel _ 
        things - sensory and emotional things - more strongly than NTs; (2) 
        we're more sensitive to other people's emotions than NTs, and thus 
        ‘catch’ their emotions faster and stronger; (3) we cycle through our 
        emotions faster than NTs (NTs perseverate emotionally); (4) we're given 
        really really really (can I stress that again? realy) bad data about what we 
        and everyone else are feeling, which throws off all subsequent 
        calculations and makes it impossible for us to get the ‘right’ answer.”

        content, you are familiar with extremely associative people. Extreme 
        associatives live in a socially constructed world and can use words for hours at 
        a time, talk about words, twist words, and never “say anything” (from our 
        point of view). They can talk about alliances, desert and other relational - 
        emotions, but might not say anything that counts as information to an 
    
        Going back to the spectrum mapped out as a bell curve, a measure of  autistcness could potentially be a measure ofthe extent ro which the brain  admits natural stimuli. The normal range is where people balance language  and nature; the low range is ike the associative who only lives in language and  can’t sce natural reality; the high range is lke the autistic who only lives in  nature and can't use words or see socal reality. 
        The concept of the “spectrum” doesn’t capture the variability in it. Some 
        people need a lot more care than others simply because they have developed — 
        an interest in things that don’t earn money, or because of physical problems 
        that are unrelated to autism. Some have suggested it is more of a “landscape”

        One area where auties have a navural advantage is in simplicity of our

        Why you will generally lose 
        For many autistics like myself, there is generally no hope in competing with  Nie on their terms. We are not playing to win; they are. Even if we could give 
        threat-based concept of | 
        friendship), 
        The NT 
        listener will hear the content related to beliefs and snflwence first, then the 
        informational content later. The message given might be factually correct, 
        but the message received might be equivalent to “It’s your fault, you moron.” 
        If the recipient hears only threats to his identity, he cannot also hear the literal  message. Thus you have started a conflict. 
        Autistic people can be mistaken as manipulative, uncaring, rude, even  dangerous sociopaths. Once this impression is given, you are the enemy, and  enemies who don’t fight will lose.

        be able to do, especially if it seems goofy. No one can give us what we are
