These examples can be multiplied by the thousands, and | 
they are not restricted to children. Any time we wish to encourage _ 
or discourage certain behaviors—getting people to lose weight or 
####page-39.png:
quit smoking, for instance—the method of choice is behavioral manipulation. Thus, when several Planned Parenthood chapters wanted to get serious about teenage pregnancy, they naturally reached for the reinforcements, in this ase by paying young mothers a dollar for every day they avoided getting pregnant again. "The Federal Government pays farmers not to plant crops," reasoned the psychologist who came up with the idea. "Why. shouldn't we pay teenagers not to have babies?” 
####page-42.png:
Ironically, rewards and punishments not only lie at the core | 
of faith but are central to our idea of rationality as well, 
particularly as it makes its presence felt in economic choices. 
Rational decision-makers, by definition, are said to seek what is _ 
leasurable and to avoid what is aversive or costly, Rationality, in| 
turn, is central to what it means to be human, at least to many _ 
‘Western thinkers. A number of writers have recently challenged - 
both steps of this argument, but pop behaviorism makes intuitive 
sense to us as a result of the assumptions built into our economic | 

In fact, behavioral psychology and orthodox economic 
theory have established a sort of mutual admiration society that" 
flatters both fields, but only by creating a truncated picture of the 
human being whose actions they seek to analyze. On the first" 
pages of their textbooks, economists often nod in the direction of | 
behaviorism to justify their fundamental assumptions about what _ 
motivates consumers or workers, Psychologists in turn assume 
####page-43.png:
that the process of weighing costs and benefits that describes how _ 
we go about purchasing an appliance is also what we are doing 
when talking with a lover. Among the features common to both — 
disciplines, moreover, is the assumption that the reward-seeking, 
punishment-avoiding impulse that drives all our behavior is_ 
necessarily and exclusively dictated by self-interest.** 
What we believe in other contexts, then, from religion to | 
economics, may pave the way for behaviorism by making us _ 
receptive to its premises, But what we see and do is also critical. 
What we see from our earliest days is the use of the carrot-and- 
stick model of motivation; most of us were raised this way, and it 
is easy to swallow such theories whole and pass along the practices - 
to our own children. Many new parents are startled when they _ 
open their mouths and hear their own parents’ expressions come | 
out, right down to the inflection. But even those who want to” 
know how their mothers managed to sneak into their larynxes- 
may not recognize how they have also absorbed basic assumptions 
from which their approach to raising children derives. 
Pop behaviorism is perpetuated through the example of 
other significant individuals in our lives, too, including teachers 
and powerful people in the workplace. |

semistarved rat in the box, with virtually nothing to do but press

####page-60.png:
This is more true of some people than — 
others, of course, and in the presence of a threatening or 
deadening environment, any of us may retreat to a strategy of — 
damage control and minimal effort. But in general we act on the - 
environment as much as we are acted on by it, and we do not do 
so simply in order to receive a reward.

If rewards bolster the traditional order of things, then the 
psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi is right to warn (or 
romise) that "to de-emphasize conventional rewards threatens _ 
the existing power structure.” 
####page-68.png:
Rewarding 
people for making changes in the existing order (which might 
include the very order that allows some individuals to be 
controllers and others controlled) is not merely unlikely but a 
contradiction in terms, "The master's tools will never dismantle _ 
the master's house,” as one writer put it. 
####page-70.png:
This may suggest a second, more sweeping objection, one_ 
that has been made not only by Skinner and Skinnerians but also” 
by social theorists with whom they have little in common: control _ 
is an unavoidable feature of human relationships; all that actually 
varies is the subtlety of the system of reinforcement. A brief smile 
and nod are just as controlling as a dollar bill—more so, perhaps, 
since social rewards may have a more enduring effect than 
tangible rewards. Just because we cannot readily identify the 
operative operant doesn’t mean it isn't there. 
####page-78.png:
Likewise, “in order 
to make people behave in a particular way ... they must be . 
needy enough so that rewards reinforce the desired behaviour.” | 
####page-84.png:
Losing weight In one dieting study, some subjects were 
promised a twice-a-week reward of five dollars each time the scale 
showed good news, while others got nothing. Those who were 
paid did make more progress at the beginning, but then gained _ 
back the weight—and then some—over the next five months. By _ 
contrast, those who had not been rewarded kept getting slimmer. _ 
‘This study was quite small, and a lot of the subjects were _ 
unavailable for measurement at the end, so we probably shouldn't | 
give it too much weight. Buta similar study published ten years _ 
later offered little solace for behaviorists: after a year, no difference 
was found between the payment and nonpayment groups. 
(Actually, there was one difference: many of those who had been 
promised money for shedding pounds failed to show up for the 
inal weigh-in.) 
Quitting smoking Losing weight and keeping it off are” 
inordinately difficult, so it may be unfair to reject pop | 
behaviorism just because it hasn't worked miracles here. The 
trouble is that it hasn't done much better elsewhere, assuming we 
are looking for long-term gains. Take smoking cessation. A very _ 
large study, published in 1991, recruited subjects for a self-help 
program designed to help people kick the habit. Some were _ 
offered a prize for turning in weekly progress reports; some got" 
feedback designed to enhance their motivation to quit; everybody _ 
else (the control group) got nothing. What happened? Prize 
recipients were twice as likely as the others to return the first 
week's report. But three months later, they were lighting up again 
####page-85.png:
more often than those who received the other treatment—and _ 
even more than those in the control group! Saliva samples _ 
revealed that subjects who had been promised prizes were twice as_ 
likely to lie about having quit. In fact, for those who received — 
both treatments, "the financial incentive somehow diminished 
the positive impact of the personalized feedback." Not only were 
rewards unhelpful; they actually did harm. 
Using seat belts Even more research has been done on - 
applying behaviorism to the promotion of seat belt use. In fact, 
an enthusiastic partisan of behaviorism and his colleagues 
reviewed the effects of twenty-eight programs used by nine _ 
different companies to get their employees to buckle up; nearly _ 
halfa million vehicle observations were made over six years in this 
research. The result: programs that rewarded people for wearing 
seat belts were the /east effective over the long haul. In follow-up 
measures ranging from a month to more than a year later, | 
programs that offered prizes or cash for buckling up found — 
changes in seat belt use ranging from a 62 percent increase to a 4_ 
percent decrease. Programs without rewards averaged a 152 
ercent increase. The authors, who clearly did not expect this 
result, had to confess that "the greater impact of the no-reward_ 
strategies from both an immediate and long-term perspective... 
[was] not predicted and [is] inconsistent with basic reinforcement 
theory.” 
####page-86.png:
In chapter 9 I will argue that precisely the same is true with 
respect to our efforts to help children become responsible and 
caring; there is no reason to expect rewards (or punishments) to 
contribute anything to these goals, because a child promised a 
treat for acting responsibly has been given no reason to keep_ 
behaving that way when there is no longer a reward to be gained | 
from doing so. 
####page-87.png:
reinforcements do not generally alter the attitudes and _ 
emotional commitments that underlie our behaviors. 
What rewards and punishments do is induce compliance, 
####page-88.png:
"The clear inferiority of the reward groups was an_ 
unexpected result, 
####page-89.png:
when the | 
task was more challenging, those who were working for the - 
nancial incentive took nearly 50 percent longer to solve the 
problem." 
####page-92.png:
(They had trouble 
breaking out of the fixed pattern of behavior that had succeeded _ 
in producing rewards for them before.) 
A few years later, Teresa Amabile, a leading student of 
creativity, published two reports that clinched the case against the 
use of rewards. In the first, young creative writers who merely | 
spent five minutes thinking about the rewards their work could 
bring (such as money and public recognition) wrote less creative _ 
poetry than others who hadn't been reflecting on these reasons ~ 
for pursuing their craft. The quality of their writing was also 
lower than the work that they themselves had done a little while 
earlier.” 
####page-93.png:
rewards killed 
creativity, : 
####page-95.png:
For whom do rewards work best? For those who are 
“alienated from their work,” according to Deutsch, 
This, of course, says something about the 
task as much as about the individuals involved; more accurately, it~ 
speaks to the relation between the two. 
####page-96.png:
This faulty application (which a behaviorist might refer to as_ 
“response overgeneralization") goes a long way toward explaining — 
why so many of our workplaces and schools are now in trouble. 
####page-97.png:
This analysis by Kenneth McGraw provides us with a good point | 
of departure from which to figure out when rewards are likely to 
fail. Subsequent investigations, for example, have confirmed that a_ 
Skinnerian approach is particularly unlikely to prove useful when 
itis creativity that we are trying to promote.” 
####page-101.png:
The troubling — 
truth is that rewards and punishments are not opposites at all; they 
are two sides of the same coin. And itis a coin that does not buy 
very much. 
####page-103.png:
Philosophical objections aside, though, if reward recipients feel 
controlled, it is likely that the experience will assume a punitive | 
quality over the long run, even though obtaining the reward itself _ 
is usually pleasurable.” 
####page-106.png:
As it happens, most studies have 
found that unexpected rewards are much less destructive than the 
rewards people are told about beforehand and are deliberately _ 
trying to obtain. | 

The stick is contained in the carrot. 
####page-108.png:
cooperation — 
does not just make tasks more pleasant; in many cases, it is- 
virtually a prerequisite for quality. More and more teachers and 
managers are coming to recognize that excellence is most likely to 
result from well-functioning teams in which resources are shared, 
skills and knowledge are exchanged, and each participant is_ 
encouraged and helped to do his or her best. 
Rewards, by contrast, are typically based on the faulty _ 
assumption "that the organization's effectiveness is the simple | 
additive combination of individuals’ separate performances," i 
####page-110.png:
The central message that is taught here—the central message of all _ 
competition, in fact—is that everyone else is a potential obstacle _ 
to one's own success. | 
Of all the ways by which people are led to seek rewards, I 
believe the most destructive possible arrangement is to limit the | 
number that are available. ‘To do so is to replace the possibility 
that people will try to assist each other with the near certainty 
that they will try to defeat each other. | 
####page-115.png:
What some observers have missed is that relationships are_ 
ruptured just as surely when we see the powerful person as_ 
someone to be pleased as when we see him or her as someone to

####page-118.png:
But the nonbehaviorist wonders how anyone could presume 
to propose a solution without knowing why the child keeps ~ 
opping out of bed. With very little effort we can imagine several 
possible reasons for this behavior. Maybe she's being put to bed _ 
too carly and simply isn't sleepy yet. Maybe she feels deprived of — 
quiet time with her parents, and the evening offers the best _ 
opportunity for her to cuddle or talk with them. Maybe she's still _ 
wound up from what happened a few hours earlier and needs to 
rehearse and clarify the day's events to try to make sense of what _ 
happened. Maybe there are monsters under her bed. Or maybe 
she can just hear people talking in the living room. (Is there _ 
anyone too old to remember how all the excitement seemed to 
start after we were put to bed?) _

Rather than | 
addressing the structural causes of poverty or the lack of perceived _ 
relevance of what the curriculum has to offer, the inclination is_ 
simply to manipulate people's behavior with a carrot or stick. | 
Some people use rewards because they are impatient for _ 
results, however fleeting or superficial: their attention is focused - 
on the bottom line and they don't particularly care about "deeper 
issues." But others are guided by the view that these issues actually _ 
make no difference. The core of behaviorism, on which some 
decisions to use behavioral strategies are based, is that human — 
beings are no more than what they do. Change what they do and 
you have dealt with the problem. One writer concisely describes _ 
behaviorism as the "confusion of inner motives with their _ 
outward expression.” But my point is not just that the | 
psychological theory is inadequate; it is that the practice is_ 
unproductive. If we do not address the ultimate cause of a 
problem, the problem will not get solved. 
####page-123.png:
The underlying principle can be summarized - 
this way: when we are working for a reward, we do exactly what is_ 
necessary to get it and no more. | 
####page-126.png:
"Reinforcement 
encourages the repetition of what has worked in the past, in part because the aim of the activity is not to produce something like a general principle ora rule, but to produce another reinforcer.”

Somehow our intrinsic interest _ 
evaporated after rewards were introduced. 
An old joke captures this phenomenon as well as any study 
could. It is the story of an elderly man who endured the insults of 
a crowd of ten-year-olds each day as they passed his house on their | 
way home from school. One afternoon, after listening to another 
round of jeers about how stupid and ugly and bald he was, the 
####page-137.png:
man came up with a plan. He met the children on his lawn the - 
following Monday and announced that anyone who came back — 
the next day and yelled rude comments about him would receive a_ 
dollar, Amazed and excited, they showed up even earlier on 
Tuesday, hollering epithets for all they were worth. True to his 
word, the old man ambled out and paid everyone. "Do the same 
tomorrow,” he told them, “and you'll get twenty-five cents for | 
your trouble.” The kids thought that was still pretty good and _ 
turned out again on Wednesday to taunt him. Ac the first catcall, 
he walked over with a roll of quarters and again paid off his" 
hecklers. "From now on," he announced, “I can give you only a 
penny for doing this.” ‘The kids looked at each other in disbelief. 
“A penny?" they repeated scornfully. "Forget it!" And they never” 
came back again.

Here, then, we have four accounts of how praise may impede performance: it signals low ability, makes people feel pressured, invites a low-risk strategy to avoid failure, and reduces interest in the task itself, Regardless of which of these seems to be operating, the evidence suggests that praise “interacts with other variables in a manner analogous to tangible rewards." *

What had not occurred to this caring teacher was the possibility that her praise might be making these children more insecure. Every time she told them, “Good job!

that perplexes behaviorists since, in their parlance, it is precisely - 
that which is not intended to reinforce that is most reinforcing.

that all these other writings are also based on a psychological _

The broader point here is that economists have it wrong if | 
they think of work as a “disutility’—something unpleasant we - 
must do in order to be able to buy what we need, merely a means 
to an end. Work can be turned into something so wretched that _ 
we come to think of it that way, but this is an aberration.” 
####page-236.png:
To this point, I have argued that money's role in the context _ 
of work is less prominent than we have assumed, When we widen 
our inquiry to look at the significance of money relative to life 
itself, the results are even more striking. As the sociologist Philip _ 
Slater once remarked, "The idea that everybody wants money is 
propaganda cir culated by wealth addicts to make themselves feel, 
better about their addiction.""

Money can also be pursued because it signifies power or status or 
provides a vague existential reassurance: I have, therefore am.

That we are dealing with a substitute satisfaction here seems 
clear from the fact that no sum ever suffices: such people always _

with which to buy them, and it is still not enough. It is never" 
enough.

Grades do serve a purpose of sorts: they “enable 
administrators to rate and sort children, to categorize them s 
rigidly that they can rarely escape."

Studies show that 
any particular teacher may well give two different grades to « 
single piece of work submitted at two different times; the 
variation is naturally even greater when the work is evaluated by _ 
more than one teacher. *\

comments should replace 
rather than supplement grades. 
The problem is not just that grades don’t say enough about — 
people's performance; it's that the process of grading fixes their 
attention on their performance.

6. Never grade on a curve. Under no circumstances should the - 
number of good grades be artificially limited so that one 
student's success makes another's less likely. "It is not a symbol 
of rigor to have grades fall into a ‘normal’ distribution; rather, it~ 
is a symbol of failure—failure to teach well, failure to test well, 
and failure to have any influence at all on the intellectual lives 
of students."*

* Elicit their curiosity. People are naturally curious about | 
things whose outcome they can't guess or, once the outcome is_ 
known, about things that didn't turn out as expected.**Adults_ 
who read stories to young children often have an intuitive 
understanding of this principle: they stop in the middle and ask, 
“What do you think is going to happen next?" or "Why do you | 
think she did that?” This is the heart of intrinsic motivation, and 
the skillful exploitation of this fact pulls older students too into 
tasks. Why would a character in a story who seems so normal not | 
be able to remember when his mother died? How can something | 
that seems so much like water stay at temperatures this low 
without freezing? What do you think happened when these _ 
people refused to back down but also refused to use violence?

* Welcome mistakes. MISTAKES ARE OUR FRIENDS, 
announces a sign seen on some classroom walls, Experienced — 
teachers watch and listen closely for when students get things 
wrong. They don't become defensive, because they know - 
mistakes don’t necessarily reflect poor teaching. They don't 
become angry, because they know mistakes don't necessarily _ 
reflect sloppiness or laziness. (If they do, the challenge is to figure’ 
out why a student is being sloppy or lazy and work together to 
solve the problem.) Mistakes offer information about how a 
student thinks. Correcting them quickly and efficiently doesn't _ 
do much to facilitate the learning process.*-More important, 
students who are afraid of making mistakes are unlikely to ask for” 
help when they need it, unlikely to feel safe enough to take 
intellectual risks, and unlikely to be intrinsically motivated.

~ Why do schools coerce children to learn things of such little valle? Seeing aside the fact that there is room for disagreement about what is valuable, I think there are several reasons: 1 + For generations, students have been drilled until their minds went to sleep; itis easiest to keep doing what has always been done. It is easier yet to avoid even questioning its value.

people learn by actively constructing knowledge, weighing new information against their previous understanding, thinking about and working through discrepancies (on their own and with others), and coming toa new

I offer a modest example from my own days as a student. | 
When I was in high school, I memorized every element on the - 
eriodic table, from actinium to zirconium. This is not an 
inherently interesting thing to do, so the circumstances in which I 
did it may be relevant here. First, the decision to learn them was_ 
####page-394.png:
my own; no one told me I had to or rewarded me when I 
succeeded. Second, I roped a couple of friends into doing it with | 
me; apart from the help people can offer each other to facilitate” 
learning, most tasks are simply more pleasant with social support. 
Third, the challenge became less tedious (and to be frank, less_ 
difficult) because what we actually did was memorize a song: the satirist Tom Lehrer had already set the names of the elements to. 
music. This made the task seem rather like a game. I'm not sure | 
which of these factors was the most decisive, but I do know that a 
couple of decades later I can still recite the entire periodic table. 
By contrast, all I remember from an entire year of advanced 
placement European history is the phrase "warm-water ports."

When about 350 high schoolers were asked about their 
objectives, “teaching a personal goal" was ranked number one, 
whereas extrinsic rewards, such as being publicly recognized for _ 
an achievement, were seen as much less important. "Winning a 
contest," in particular, showed up at the very bottom of the list. 
Ina striking parallel to the data on employee goals, teachers who _ 
were asked what motivated students incorrectly assumed that _ 
extrinsic motivators were more important to students than they _ 
actually were.”
