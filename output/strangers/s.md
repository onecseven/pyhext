Some people are blessed by knowing exactly what it is their hearts 
desire, but are cursed by not knowing how to achieve it. Like King Lear, some 
stumble into a course of action precisely opposite to the one that would — 
satisfy their hearts and minds. | 
Consider Marcel, in Proust's Remembrance of Things Past, who 
is convinced that he no longer loves Albertine and broods and plots and_ 
schemes about ways of leaving her, until his housekeeper rushes in with the 
news that Albertine has left him. At the instant he hears the words, Marcel _ 
realizes how much he still loves Albertine: 
"These words: ‘Mademoiselle 
Albertine has gone!’ had expressed themselves in my heart in the form of an_ 
anguish so keen that I would not be able to endure it for any length of time. 
And so what I had supposed to mean nothing to me was the only thing in my 
whole life, How ignorant we are of ourselves."

Understanding the causes of our

In the first half of the twentieth century, the - 
behaviorist onslaught in psychology was fueled by a rejection of mentalism; behaviorists argued that there was no need to take into account what occurred inside people's heads, consciously or unconsciously. In the ate 195% mainstream psychology took the giant step of rejecting behaviorism and 
initiating the systematic study of the mind. 
####page-13.png:
some researchers have gone so far as to suggest that the unconscious ~ 
mind does virtually all the work and that conscious will may be an illusion. 
####page-14.png:
it is clear that the modern, adaptive unconscious is not the same as the 
psychoanalytic one. 
####page-16.png:
The therapeutic process involves the elucidation and circumvention of — 
unhealthy defenses, which is difficult precisely because people are so 
motivated to keep their unconscious motives and feelings hidden, 
Consciousness is a limited-capacity system, and to survive in the - 
world people must be able to process a great deal of information outside of 
awareness. ( 
####page-24.png:
research on the adaptive unconscious suggests that 
much of what we want to see is unseeable. 
####page-26.png:
that what we are conscious of is constructed — 
out of what we are not conscious of-that our whole knowledge, in fact, is_ 
made up of the unknown and incognisable.

Thus, the best way to begin describing 
the parts of our minds we cannot observe directly is perhaps to describe what 
it would be like to lose our nonconscious minds. 
####page-28.png:
It is only the loss of the hidden proprioceptive system, as in 
Mr. Waterman's case, that demonstrates how important it is.

thoughts such as these as residing in the “preconscious,” the mental anteroom — 
in which thoughts remain until they “succeed in attracting the eye of 
consciousness."4

memorization we often dread. * 
Humans 
learn to speak with no effort or intention; it just happens. 
Implicit learning is one of the most important functions of the adaptive 

####page-36.png:
A striking demonstration of implicit learning is a study by Pawel Lewicki, 
Thomas Hill, and Elizabeth Bizot. The participant's task was to watch a— 
computer screen that was divided into four quadrants. On each trial, the letter _ 
X appeared in a quadrant, and the participant pressed one of four buttons to 
indicate which one. Unbeknownst to the participant, the presentations of the 
X's were divided into blocks of twelve thar followed a complex rule, For 
example, the X never appeared in the same square two times in a row; the 
third location depended on the location of the second; the fourth location 
depended on the location of the preceding two trials; and an X never 
“returned” to its original location until it had appeared in at least two of the 
other squares. Although the exact rules were complicated, participants 
appeared to learn them, As time went by their performance steadily improved, — 
and they became faster and faster at pressing the correct button when the X_ 
appeared on the screen, None of the participants, however, could verbalize” 
what the rules were or even that they had learned anything. 
That they learned the complex rules nonconsciously was shown by what 
happened next in the experiment. The researchers suddenly changed the rules 
so that the clues predicting where the X would appear were no longer valid, 
and the participants’ performance deteriorated. They took a very long time to 
identify the location of the X and made several mistakes. Although 
participants noticed that they could no longer do the task very well, none of — 
them knew why, They had no awareness that they had learned rules that no 
longer applied. Instead, they consciously searched for other explanations for 
their sudden poor performance. 
Incidentally, the participants were psychology professors who knew that the 
study concerned nonconscious learning, Despite this knowledge, they had no 
idea what they had learned or why their performance suddenly deteriorated. 
Three of the professors said that their fingers had "suddenly lost the rhythm,” 
and two were convinced that the experimenters had flashed distracting — 
subliminal pictures on the screen.”

The adaptive unconscious is thus more than just a gatekeeper, deciding what 
information to admit to consciousness. It is also a spin doctor that interprets 
information outside of awareness. ( 
####page-46.png:
Our conscious mind is often too slow to figure out what the | 
best course of action is, so our nonconscious mind does the job for us and_ 
sends us signals (e.g., gut feelings) that tell us what to do. 
People with damage to the prefrontal cortex find it difficult to know where to 
point the spotlight of attention.

‘When information is high in 
activation potential it is “energized” and ready to be used; when it is low in 
activation potential it is unlikely to be used to select and interpret 
information in one's environment. Accessibility is determined not only by the 
self-relevance of a category but also by how recently it has been encountered. 
####page-48.png:
The adaptive unconscious is not governed by accuracy and accessibility alone. 
People's judgments and interpretations are often guided by a quite different 
concern, namely the desire to view the world in the way that gives them the 
most pleasure-what can be called the “feel-good" criterion. J 
One of the most enduring lessons from social psychology is that like Mrs. 
Reed, people go to great lengths to view the world in a way that maintains a 
sense of well-being, '

As Freud noted, 
psychological defenses often work best when they operate in the back alleys of 
our minds, keeping us blind to the fact that any distortion is going on. If _ 
people knew that they were changing their beliefs just to make themselves feel _ 
better, the change would not be as compelling.

We often 
experience a thought followed by an action, and assume it was the thought — 
that caused that action. In fact a third variable, a nonconscious intention, — 
might have produced both the conscious thought and the action. }

What it 
next week, or next year, wat will happen tomorrow, cannot do is anticipate wha apy

‘The practice of agriculture, for

happen to them over the next few weeks? 
####page-63.png:
No one is born with a specific stereotype about another — 
group, but once we learn these stereotypes, usually from our immediate 
culture, we are inclined to apply them nonconsciously, unintentionally, 
uncontrollably, and effortlessly. In contrast, conscious thinking occurs more _ 
slowly, with intention (we typically think what we want to think), control (we 
are better able to influence what we think about), and effort (it is hard to keep _ 
our conscious minds on something when we are distracted or preoccupied)."" 
And yet once a correlation is learned, the nonconscious system: 
####page-64.png:
tends to see it where it does not exist, thereby becoming more convinced that 
the correlation is true. |

It is fair to say that the tendency for the adaptive unconscious to jump to conclusions, and to fil to change its mind in the face of contrary evidence s responsible for some of society's most eroubling problems, such as the PEVASNEHES of RiAlpAEAUAIEE (discussed in Chapter 9). Why would an

If there really are two systems implicated in these studies, a nonconscious one 
that determines what people do and a conscious one that determines what 
people say, are there ways of getting them more in synch?

Numerous studies on covariation detection show that the conscious system is 
notoriously bad at detecting correlations between two variables (¢.g.. whether —

The adaptive 
unconscious is an older system designed to scan the environment quickly and 
detect patterns, especially ones that might pose a danger to the organism, It 
learns patterns easily but does not unlearn them very well; it is a fairly rigid, 
inflexible inferencemaker. It develops early and continues to guide behavior 
into adulthood.

Walter Mischel found that none of 
the approaches met the gold standard of personality research very well, 
namely Allport's criterion of predicting with any certainty what people 
actually do. An extravert should make friends more easily than an introvert, 
whereas a conscientious person should meet more deadlines than a person_ 
who is not conscientious. Mischel found, however, that the typical correlation 
between personality traits and behavior was quite modest. This news shook — 
up the field, because it essentially said that the traits personality psychologists 
were measuring were just slightly better than astrological signs at predicting behavior —— 
####page-82.png:
This argument set off a tartwar between personality psychologists, who place_ 
their bets on individual differences as the best predictors of behavior, and

Sam's cognitive and affective personality system causes him to feel threatened when he perceives that he is being ignored by significant others, and that is 
when he is most likely to act aggressively. / 
My central thesis is that human personality resides in two places: in the 
adaptive unconscious and in conscious construals of the self. 
####page-84.png:
The constructed self consists of - 
life stories, possible selves, explicit motives, selftheories, and beliefs about the reasons for one’s feelings and behaviors, As Joan Didion says, "We tell ourselves storics in order to live. 
####page-89.png:
Because representations of - 
relationships with significant others are self-relevant and frequently brought to mind, they become chronically accessible and are often used eo interpret and evaluate new people we meet, In short, ast asthe construct of "honest or “kindness’ can be activated and applied to a new person, so can the construct ofa specific person such as “my mother” or ‘Uncle Henry.”

If we were to make a list of the goals that are most important in life, surely the 
desire for close relationships, success in life (¢-g., a career), and power would — 
make most people's short list. There is a long tradition in personality 
psychology of studying these three motives; indeed, psychologists such as H. 
A. Murray and David McClelland have argued that people's level of needs for - 
affiliation, achievement, and power are major components of human 
personality. 
There is growing evidence that these motives are an important part of the personality of the adaprve unconscious. Murray and McClelland assumed that these basic motives are not necessarily conscious and must therefore be measured indirectly. They advocated the use ofthe Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), in which people make up stories about ast of standard pictures, and these stories are then coded for how much of a nee for affiliation, power, or achievement people expressed. Oo 
A controversy has ensued over which measure of 
motivation is the most valid; the TAT or self-report questionnaires. The — 
answer, I suggest, is that both are valid measures but tap different levels of © 
motivation, one that resides in the adaptive unconscious and the other that is_ 
part of people's conscic ious explanator cplanatory system. 
####page-95.png:
Implicit motives are needs that people acquire in childhood that have become 
automatic and nonconscious. Self-attributed motives are people's conscious 
theories about their needs that may often differ from their nonconscious 

unconscious and the conscious explanatory system each has its own set of needs and motives that influence different types of behaviors.

is clear that people's conscious beliefs about their 
traits and motives play a causal role (albeit not as much as they might think). 
The conscious self system is not completely epiphenomenal; as we have seen, 
explicit beliefs about attachment and motivation influence some important 
social behaviors. 
####page-101.png:
For example, the extent to 
which mothers used scheduled feedings correlated with the implicit but not 
explicit need for achievement in the adult sample, and the extent to which the 
mothers were unresponsive to their infants’ crying was correlated with the 
implicit but not explicit need for affiliation. | 
####page-102.png:
the children of parents who set explicit tasks for them to learn were more 
likely to have an explicit but not implicit need for achievement.” 
To understand better our own nonconscious personality dispositions, we 
cannot simply remove the veil obscuring our view, for there is no direct view

Some individuals, however, did have nonconscious and conscious motives that corresponded, and these people chowed greater emotional well-being 
than people whose goals were out of synch.

It appears to 
be to people's advantage to develop conscious theories that correspond at least somewhat with the personality oftheir adaptive unconscious. 30

If you walked into the room he might decide that you were a customer 
entering the delicatessen he used to own and would ask whether you wanted a 
pastrami or ham sandwich. But then “click,” change of scene. He might notice 
that you were wearing a white coat and would invent a new story-you are the 
butcher from down the street. “Click,” new scene. The butcher always had 
bloodstains on his coat; so you must be a doctor, Mr, Thompson would see 
no inconsistencies in his changing stories. He came up with perfectly good — 
explanations for his current circumstances, with no idea that these 
explanations changed from moment to moment. Sacks describes it this way: 
"[Mr. Thompson} continually improvised a world around him-an Arabian 
Nights world, a phantasmagoria, a dream, of ever-changing people, figures, 
situations-continual, kaleidoscopic mutations and transformations. For Mr. 
Thompson, however, it was not a tissue of ever-changing, evanescent fancies 
and illusion, but a wholly normal, stable and factual world. So far as he was 
concerned, there was nothing the matter,”

‘The researchers then asked P. S. why he had picked the cards he did. Like

(because the snow scene was viewed only by the right hemisphere). No- 
problem; the left hemisphere quickly made up an answer: “I saw a claw and 
picked a chicken, and you have to clean out the chicken shed with a shovel." 
Perhaps the most striking thing about P. S.’s response is that he seemed 
perfectly comfortable with his answer and had no idea that it was a 
confabulation, In Gazzaniga and LeDoux's words, “The left [hemisphere] did 
not offer its suggestion in a guessing vein but rather asa statement of fact as to 
why that card had been picked.

Although I think the incorrigibility argument is wrong, there are two good” 
reasons why it has persisted: the measurement problem and the theory 
problem. The measurement problem is that even if people can be wrong 
about their feelings in principle, we have no way of knowing if and when this 
is the case, because we do not have a pipeline to people's feelings that is” 
independent of their self-reports. The theory problem is the question of how 
and why the mind would be organized in such a way that people can be 
wrong about their feelings. Why on earth would humans be buile this way? 
Although both the measurement and theory problem are formidable, I 
believe they can be overcome.

All the videos the men watched depicted consensual sexual behavior between 
two adults. One film showed heterosexual sex between a man and a woman, — 
one showed lesbian sex between two women, and one showed homosexual sex 
between two men, The two groups of men showed similar levels of arousal (as 
measured by the plethysmograph) to the heterosexual and lesbian videos. — 
Consistent with the psychoanalytic hypothesis of reaction formation, 
however, the homophobic men showed significantly greater increases in 
penile erection to the male homosexual film than did nonhomophobic men- 
even though the homophobic men claimed that they were no more aroused — 
by the homosexual film than nonhomophobic men said they were.

James argued that the perception of environmental events triggers bodily _ 
responses, which then trigger conscious emotions; “we feel sorry because we 
cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble." In his famous |

run, and then experience a post-hoc fear that played no causal role in our| 
flecing-much like the "whoosh" of fear I experienced after regaining control of

We notice that we have been avoiding Topper and that we are 
apprehensive in his presence, and infer correctly that we can’t stand him. 
Sometimes, though, the conscious system gets it wrong. One way this can 
happen is that people fail to notice that a feeling has changed until their 
attention is drawn to it. Over a century ago, William Carpenter argued for the 
existence of such "unnoticed" feelings, such as “the growing up of a powerful — 
attachment between individuals of opposite sexes, without either being aware 
of the fact." Carpenter noted that "The existence of a mutual attachment, — 
indeed, is often recognised by a bystander ... before either of the parties has_ 
made the discovery ... the Cerebral state manifests itself in action, although no_ 
distinct consciousness of that state has been attained, chiefly because, the 
whole attention being attracted by the present enjoyment, there is little 
disposition to introspection."0 
####page-145.png:
Because everyone knows that "children 
love their pony,” it is difficult for them to notice that Topper is a nasty brute- 
not because it would be especially anxiety-provoking to do so, but because it is 
diffi cult to see through the smokescreen of cultural and personal feeling rules. 
####page-148.png:
In short, people's adaptive unconscious inferred that the film was funny, 
which caused them to laugh a lot. When asked how funny the film was, 
people based their response on their personal theories about their liking for 
this type of film. The adaptive unconscious felt one way, whereas people's” 
conscious selves felt differently-just like Blake and Kate's attitudes toward 
Topper, and my friend Susan's feelings about Stephen. 
####page-150.png:
It might even be the case that the default is for feelings to emerge into 
awareness, and that it takes special circumstances to prevent them from doing — 
so, We have seen three such circumstances. The first is repression, whereby — 
forces are brought into play to hide a threatening feeling (as in the case of — 
homophobia), The second is inattention, or the failure to notice that a feeling — 
has changed (as in Carpenter's example of falling in love). The third is the 
obscuring of feelings by the smoke screen of people's conscious theories and 
confabulations. People fail to recognize a feeling or evaluation if it conflicts 
with a cultural feeling rule ("people love their ponies,” “my wedding day will | 
be the happiest time of my life"), a personal standard ("I am not prejudiced at 
all toward African Americans’), or conscious theories and inferences about 
how one feels ("I must love him because he conforms to my idea of Mr. 
Right’).

Psychological processes are triggered, I suggest, that transform the events from the extraordinary tothe ordinary, in a way that robs them of their emotional power. We weave events into our knowledge of ourselves and the world, in a way that makes the event seem normal, ordinary, even expected. When something happens that is novel or inconsistent with people's expectations about the world, they engage in mental work to come to terms with and explain the new event. If possible, people assimilate it into cheir current theories and expectations. Doing this often involves a reconstrual of the event to make it seem more understandable and predictable.

If people's proclivity to make sense of the world spoils the pleasure they experience from novel events, then it follows that those who have difficulty making sense should obtain more long-lasting pleasure, This seems to be a small benefit of the tragedy of Alzheimer’s disease, People who suffer from Alzheimer's lose the ability to form new memories and thus cannot explain novel evens in any lasting way.

Given all the evidence for how resilient people are, it is striking that people — 
don't realize this when predicting their emotional reactions to future events. 
Daniel Gilbert and I have found evidence for this lack of appreciation of © 
resilience-the durability bias-in numerous studies. In one, college football fans 
predicted how happy they would be in the days following a victory or loss by _ 
their favorite team. They anticipated that the outcome of the game would 
influence their overall happiness for two to three days, but it did not. By the 
following day, people were back to their normal level of happiness. In another, — 
assistant professors predicted that the outcome of their tenure decision would — 
have a large impact on their overall happiness for five years after the decision. 
In fact, professors who had received tenure in the previous five years were not 
significantly happier than professors who had been denied tenure.22

For example, in another study we compared people who were asked to list — 
reasons about why their relationship was going the way it was with people 
who did not list reasons, Whose feelings did the best job of predicting the 
longevity of the relationship? It was the latter group, who did not analyze 
reasons. This is consistent with the notion that when people analyzed reasons, 
they constructed stories based on faulty data, such as which aspects of the 
relationship were easiest to put into words, were on their minds, or were 
consistent with their theories about how they should feel, leading to attitudes 
that were less well informed than those of people in the control group, who 
just gave their unanalyzed, gut feelings. As Goethe put it, "He who deliberates 
lengthily will not always choose the best,” rgthily: ays 
A study of people's attitudes toward works of art tested Goethe's hunch. — 
Some people analyzed exactly why they liked or disliked five art posters and 
some did not. Then, all participants chase one of the posters to take home. 
Two weeks later, we called people up and asked them how happy they were 
with the poster they had chosen. Benjamin Franklin might predict that the 
people who analyzed their reasons would make the best choices, by carefully — 
laying out the pros and cons of each option, We found the opposite: the 
people who did not list reasons, and presumably based their choices on their 
unanalyzed gut feelings, were happier with their posters than were the people 
who had listed reasons. Like Mario Vargas Llosa, who found it difficult to tell _ 
how he felt about the films when he analyzed each one, the students in the 
reasons analysis group seemed to lose sight of which poster they really liked 
the best.” -

####page-226.png:
The central proposition of his self- 
perception theory is that people infer their internal states just as an outside 
observer would, by seeing how they behave and guessing what feelings or 
traits must underlie that behavior.

unaware. It is not such a good strategy if it results in the fabrication of new feclings. 
In fact almost all the experiments on self-perception theory are examples of 
self-fabrication, whereby people misunderstand the real reason for their 4 
behavior and make mistaken inferences about their internal states. Many of © 
these studies are ones in which people, like Sarah, underestimate the power of © 
the situation over their behavior and mistakenly inter that they did what they _ 
did because of their inner feelings or attitudes. In a study conducted at Yale 
University, for example, students agreed to go to a street corner and gather 
signatures on a petition to reduce air pollution in New Haven. In one 
condition participants heard an experimental accomplice also agree to the 
request, and remark that he did so because he "wouldn't mind convincing — 
people about something I really believe in." Whar, if anything, should the 
students learn about themselves from the fact that they, too, agreed to collect 
the signatures? 
The real reason most people agreed was that the experimenter was quite 
persuasive and made it hard to say no, as evidenced by the fact that all 
students did agree to the onerous request. Instead of saying, “I did it because 
the guy twisted my arm,” though, people mistakenly inferred that their 
behavior was a reflection of a strong attitude-stronger than they had actually _ 
felt before. In other words, they engaged in selffabrication. It is quite common 
for people to overlook situational influences on their actions and infer that 
they acted on the basis of their internal states-so common that this 
phenomenon is called the fundamental attribution error. 
####page-229.png:
In most studies of the fundamental attribution error, the situational - 
influences are rather subtle (such as an experimenter applying pressure to 
convince us to get signatures for a good cause) and easy to miss. What if the 
situational constraints or incentives are obvious? In these cases people 
correctly recognize that their behavior was caused by situational demands and 
thereby stop themselves from fabricating internal states. If our supervisor asks 
us to buy Girl Scout Cookies from his daughter's troop, and not-so-subtly_ 
implies that our next raise is contingent on saying yes, we will probably 
attribute our purchase of ten boxes of Thin Mints to his arm-twisting, rather _ 
than to the idea that the Girl Scouts are now our favorite charity and Thin 
Mints our favorite snack. 
But if situational influences are too strong, people make a different kind of 
self-fabrication error: they overattribute their actions to the situation, and 
underestimate how much they wanted to perform the behavior. Suppose that 
Bill has always loved to play the guitar and spends hours practicing. What _ 
happens when he also has a strong situational reason for the same activity, 
such as playing at a wedding for an enormous fee? It might seem as if Bill 
would enjoy the performance all the more, because he now has two reasons 
and his love of guitar playing. for doing it: the money he is earning and his love of guitar pl 
Many studies show that in situations like this, people in fact overattribute 
their behavior to the situation and underestimate their intrinsic interest in the 
activity. The more Bill plays professionally, the less he is likely to enjay playing — 
the guitar, because he infers that he is “doing it for the money,” not because he 
loves it. This is another form of selffabrication: because of a strong situational — 
incentive or demand, people underestimate the magnitude of their internal, 
interest in the activity.’ 5

People's conscious stories about 
themselves are often too negative or limiting, and it is to their benefit to revise | 
these stories to better match their nonconscious traits, abilities, and feelings. 
####page-233.png:
Aristotle suggested that "We acquire [virtues} by first having 
put them into action ... we become just by the practice of just actions, self- controlled by exercising self-control, and courageous by performing acts of courage.” William James offered similar advice: "Seize the very fist possible opportunity to act on every resolution you make, and on every emotional prompting you may experience in the direction of habits you aspite to gain” Tn other words. the first ctep to changing our nonefescious inclinations is to. 
One of the most enduring lessons of social psychology — 
is that behavior change often precedes changes in attitudes and feelings. 
####page-235.png:
Deliberately changing our behavior is beneficial beyond the practice it gives in 
a new way of acting. It also promotes a new self-definition. The more I find — 
myself chatting comfortably with a new acquaintance at a party, or gathering — 
steam in a lecture to a large class, the more my view of myself changes. This 
can happen at both a nonconscious and a conscious level. My adaptive 
unconscious is more likely to draw the inference that I am an outgoing — 
person, and this inference has become a part of my conscious self-narrative as_ 
well. The more my self-definition changes, the easier it becomes to act in yet 
more extraverted ways automatically, rather than having to force myself to 
make the effort, Automatic selves produce automatic actions. The new 
“extraverted” Tim takes the controls and steers me in directions I never would — 
have gone before, like chatting amiably with the person sitting next to me on a 
plane, rather than keeping my nose in a book.

Gergen and Kaye attempt to avoid this trap by arguing for a different 
definition of narrative utility, namely the idea that narratives exist within 
specific "games of language, one or more cultural dances,” and can be judged — 
only “within the confines of a particular game or dance.” “Utility,” they argue, 
“is to be derived from their success as moves within these arenas-in terms of 
their adequacy as reactions to previous moves or as instigators to what 
follows.

It may seem that we have come full circle back to Freud, by arguing that_ 
people's conscious beliefs about themselves should match their unconscious — 
goals and drives. Isn't this the same thing as saying that the goal of therapy is 
to “make the unconscious conscious?" In a sense it is. But as should now be 
clear, the nature of the unconscious that should be captured in a narrative 
differs radically from the Freudian one. And there are clear differences 
between the viewpoints in how to make the unconscious conscious. There is 
no direct pipeline to the adaptive unconscious; it must be inferred by being a 
good self-biographer (perhaps with the aid of a skilled therapist), not by 
removing repression and taking a peek at the bubbling cauldron below,
